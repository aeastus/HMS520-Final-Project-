## Summary
HMS 520 Autumn quarter 2021 final project public repository. This repository includes presentation information, all of the component scripts, and the description of our project. 

## About
The goal of this final project is to create a set of functions to clean validate finished extraction datasets from "by hand" scientific literature systematic review extractions. It performs these key functions:
1) Check for missingness in user-defined columns
2) Check for duplicates, using user-defined expected groupings of unique observations
3) Apply user-specified custom validations
4) Check for potential outlier candidates using Mean Absolute Deviation
5) Split dataset into multiple bundles based on user-specified criteria
6) Writes out a folder with diagnostic `.xlsx` and `.txt` files describing the checks that were applied.

The only two scripts you will need to touch are:
1) `config.R`
2) `save_report.R`
The rest are child scripts called by `save_report.R`

## First step: Setting up your config
`config.R`: generates `config.RDS`, which is the config file of a list of all your inputs that is fed into the parent script. Modify the arguments in `config.R` to fit your use case. Arguments:
* `source_dir` <- string; directory where your repository is located and from which you source your functions
* `config_dir` <- string; directory where you save `config.RDS`
* `data_path` <- string; full path to where you have your data, must be `.xlsx`
* `ages_path` <- string; full path to where you have your GBD age data table (for age-standardizing outliering), must be `.xlsx`
* `output_root` <- string; directory where you save your output diagnostic files. creates `output_dir`, a date-versioned folder in `output_root`
* `vars_check` <- character vector; vector of variable names that you want to check for missingness in `missing_check.R`
* `byvars` <- character vector; vector of variable names which define what you expect to be a unique group in `duplicate_check.R` and also used in `outlier_check.R`
* `validation_criteria` <- character list; list of criteria used for custom validation in `validation_check.R`
* `n` <- integer; number of deviations to flag for potential outliering, default is 3
* `flag_zeros` <- boolean; whether to flag zeros for potential outliering (generally T for common causes, F for rare causes)
* `bundle_args` <- data.table; has three columns where each row corresponds to a bundle that you are splitting out of the parent dataset into its own `.csv` in `bundle_split.R`. 

## Second step: Running the parent script
`save_report.R`: This is the parent file. You will need to update the source_dir and the `config_dir` to reflect your directories. All other inputs read from `config.RDS`. It runs the child scripts and outputs a set of diagnostic files to your output directory. 

## The child scripts
The child scripts are launched from save_report.R in this order:
1) `missing_check.R`
2) `duplicate_check.R`
3) `outlier_check.R`
4) `validation_check.R`
5) `write_outputs.R`
6) `bundle_split.R`
* Their functions correspond to the numbered descriptions in the "about" section. 
* Additional information on inputs and outputs for each function is available in the function headers.

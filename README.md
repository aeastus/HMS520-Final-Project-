## Summary
HMS 520 final project public repository. This repository includes presentation information, all of the component scripts, and the description of our project. 

## About
The goal of this final project is to create a set of functions to clean, standardize, and validate finished extraction datasets from "by hand" scientific literature systematic review extractions, then split them into bundle-specific subsets as preparation to upload to the epi-database. The functions will take in arguments that the user can configure to suit the specific cause. Running the script that launches the full set of functions produces 1. a unified report of rows which failed each check as a record of data-cleaning modifications, and 2. one or more bundle-specific subset data files, named with the bundle_id, in each of which all rows meet that bundle's user-specifed criteria.

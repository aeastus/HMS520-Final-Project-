#The format you choose
Format will include creating a package or set of functions. (Also will likely include analyzing a dataset that uses data wrangling)

#The overall goal of the project
The goal of this project is to put together a set of functions to clean and standardize and validate finished extraction datasets from "by hand" sci-lit systematic review extractions. An additional goal is to incorporate automatic detection of potential outliers within a datset to aid in vetting.

These functions will be designed for the use cases of the IHME GBD teams Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) and HIV/TB/Select Infectious Diseases (HIV/TB/IDs). NTDs tends to have fairly sparse data: the biggest datasets have ~10k rows, and most are <3000 rows. HIV/TB/IDs has larger datasets which include clinical data, in the ~100k row range. The functions will use both `data.table` and `dplyr` for data wrangling.

The medium-term plan is to turn the code into an interactive R-markdown notebook that takes in parameters, does the cleaning, and then cranks out upload-ready csv datasets along with an automated report documenting the cleaning which was done. 

#Detailed plans and timeline
Steph has a pile of usual-suspect errors and inconsistencies to check, written up as a text checklist. And Central Comp maintains an existing shared function to validate datasets for epi-database upload; I would call that shared function as a last step.
Approximate timeline:
Week 1. Compile function and feature "wishlist". Select test datasets. Define division of work and who will write which functions.
Week 2. Work on / write functions.
Week 3. Peer review of each others' functions, finalization.
